Scripts in this folder simulate an error scenario when the server's certificate is expired. When the intermediate CA signs the server certificate, it sets the start date to 01/01/2015 and the end date 01/01/2016 (see line 110 in ./create_certs). In this scenario, the client cannot trust the server and cannot get the a.txt successfully, raising error 10: certificate has expired. 

In general, this kind of error is caused by the invalid certificate time, i.e. current time is not between the valid start and end time of the client or server certificate. I can modify the start and the end time of the client-side certificate to 01/01/2015 and 01/01/2016 to get the same error 10. Changing start time to a future time like 01/01/2030 will cause error 9: certificate is not yet valid, which is the same type of error.
