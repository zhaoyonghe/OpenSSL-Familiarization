Scripts in this folder simulate an error scenario when the client side does not have the trusted CA chain, raising error 19: self signed certificate in certificate chain. In this scenario, the client can get the a.txt successfully because the root CA self-signed certificate of the server is not trusted by the client. The same modification to the ./start_server.sh can cause the same error.
